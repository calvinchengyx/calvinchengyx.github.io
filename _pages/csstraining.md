# CSS Training

This is a self-developed training roadmap for any people who are interested in doing computational social science research. The roadmap is designed to help myself to learn CSS from scratch. With the communication background, I started from a time when there is no such a concept of CSS. I have learned a lot from my friends, colleagues, and the internet. I also made countless mistakes and wasted a significant amount of time along the way. I hope this roadmap can track my progress of doing CSS, and help future people to learn this field more efficiently and effectively, avoiding the mistakes I made. 

This roadmap benefits a lot from the following piece: [Training Computational Social Science PhD Students for Academic and Non-Academic Careers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/training-computational-social-science-phd-students-for-academic-and-nonacademic-careers/1455690939833B9FFCAC664D4E412057)

## 1. Training 
Trainings includes three parts: social science theories, research methods (both statistics and computational methods), and research design. 
### 1.1 Social Science Theories 
- todo - list theory classes i have taken
### 1.2 Computational Methods
1. Programming basics with Python/R
    - todo - list python classes i have taken
    - todo - list an area of data science skills and pick one to develop - NLP
2. Machine Learning
    - todo - list ML classes i have taken
3. Large Language Models (new)
    - todo - list classes i have taken
4. others: Network Analysis, Text Analysis, and other computational methods
5. equivalently, you should also be familiar with traditional research methods (experiments, surveys, qualitative methods, etc.)
    - todo - list classes i have taken
### 1.3 Statistics for Social Science Research
- todo - list stats classes i have taken, 
- todo list Liang's weird statistics
### 1.4 Research Design
1. list research design classes i have taken (paper design)
2. version control (git)

## 2. Project Based Research
I think the key difference between CSS and social science scholars are their outputs. CSS not only cares about papers/publication, but also cares about the reproducibility of the research and codes. With basic knowledge of theory, methods, and design, you should start to work on projects, and the rest of your career will be project-based. they are the main content in your portfolio. 

-- todo - add Project based research working pipeline (workflow)

## 3. Connection with the Community
1. seminars
2. conferences/workshop (IC2S2, ICA)
3. social media (twitter, linkedIn, github)
4. teaching
