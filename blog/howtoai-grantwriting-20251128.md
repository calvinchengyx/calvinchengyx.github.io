# HowToAI - Grant Writing

> `HowToAI` series is a collection of personal notes on how I use AI tools to increase efficiency and quality of my work, while increase the awareness of side effects and risks of using AI tools. The ultimate goal is to use AI tools safely with deminishing my cognitive capablity as a knowledge worker.

## Overall Strategy
1. outline the traditional work flow of writing a research grant
2. identify points that can be improved (faster and higher quality) with AI tools
3. identify best AI tools, prompts and work flows to achieve the improvement
4. evaluate the result and iterate
5. finalize the new work flow with AI tools integrated
6. output a step-by-step guide for using AI tools to write research grants in the future 

## Traditional Work Flow of Writing a Research Grant
1. bullet points of research ideas
2. expand bullet points into a research proposal
3. revise the research proposal with feedback from colleagues
    1. fit with the funder's call
    2. theoretical significance
    3. methodological feasibility and appropriateness
    4. clear implication and impact, benetfits to different stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, practitioners, general public)
    5. clarity and conciseness of writing
    6. budget justification
4. proofreading and formatting
5. submission

## Identifying Points for Improvement with AI Tools
In this note, I use my application to [Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships) as an example. 

### Step 1: Bullet Points of Research Ideas
(Same) First draft with bullet points of research ideas. I spent about 1 hour brainstorming and writing down the bullet points of my research ideas, including project aim, scope, case selection, theories, methodology, and outcome ([prepare for institutional internal review - one pager](https://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/leverhulme-trust-early-career-fellowships)).

Pain point: I need brainstorm more ideas, especially the novelty, and theorization of the research project. traditionally, i would read more literature to get inspiration. This is time consuming (easily 3-6 hours). I can use AI tools to help me brainstorming ideas. 

How AI can help? I feed in the context (writing a research proposal - one page), i feed in my potential collaborators' expertise, I ask for ideas on each bullet points with references and justifications. I prompt the conversation to be structured as Socratic dialogue to stimulate more critical thinking. (budget time: 1 hour). Then I only read those references suggested and picked useful by me. Here the major change is i switched the `toberead` list from using "google scholar + keywords + scan" => "Socratic dialogue + AI suggested references".

### Step 2: Expand Bullet Points into a Research Proposal
