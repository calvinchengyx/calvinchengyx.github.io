# HowToAI - Grant Writing

> `HowToAI` series is a collection of personal notes on how I use AI tools to increase efficiency and quality of my work, while increase the awareness of side effects and risks of using AI tools. The ultimate goal is to use AI tools safely with deminishing my cognitive capablity as a knowledge worker.

## Overall Strategy
1. outline the traditional work flow of writing a research grant
2. identify points that can be improved (faster and higher quality) with AI tools
3. identify best AI tools, prompts and work flows to achieve the improvement
4. evaluate the result and iterate
5. finalize the new work flow with AI tools integrated
6. output a step-by-step guide for using AI tools to write research grants in the future 

## Traditional Work Flow of Writing a Research Grant
1. bullet points of research ideas
2. expand bullet points into a research proposal
3. revise the research proposal with feedback from colleagues
    1. fit with the funder's call
    2. theoretical significance
    3. methodological feasibility and appropriateness
    4. clear implication and impact, benetfits to different stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, practitioners, general public)
    5. clarity and conciseness of writing
    6. budget justification
4. proofreading and formatting
5. submission

## Identifying Points for Improvement with AI Tools
In this note, I use my application to [Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships) as an example. 

### Step 1: Bullet Points of Research Ideas
(Same) First draft with bullet points of research ideas. I spent about 1 hour brainstorming and writing down the bullet points of my research ideas, including project aim, scope, case selection, theories, methodology, and outcome ([prepare for institutional internal review - one pager](https://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/leverhulme-trust-early-career-fellowships)).

Pain point: I need brainstorm more ideas, especially the novelty, and theorization of the research project. traditionally, i would read more literature to get inspiration. This is time consuming (easily 3-6 hours). I can use AI tools to help me brainstorming ideas. 

How AI can help? I feed in the context (writing a research proposal - one page), i feed in my potential collaborators' expertise, I ask for ideas on each bullet points with references and justifications. I prompt the conversation to be structured as Socratic dialogue to stimulate more critical thinking. (budget time: 1 hour). Then I only read those references suggested and picked useful by me. Here the major change is i switched the `toberead` list from using "google scholar + keywords + scan" => "Socratic dialogue + AI suggested references".

time spent record: 1hour for bullet points. Then i got feedback from Andreu, and incorporated the feedback for the first one-pager. 

### Step 2: Expand Bullet Points into a Research Proposal

pain point: hard to illustrate abstract ideas logically and coherently. 

AI use: iterate with AI for logics, paragraph by paragraph. (1) write a paragaraph raw (2) fit into AI with it and basic logic (3) ask with socratic dialogue to improve the logic and clarity (4) evalute the suggestion and rewrite. (5) repeat (3)-(4) until satisfied with the paragraph with a clearere logic. 

DONT: copy-paste AI generated text directly. Always rewrite yourself. otherwise, you are risking of not internalizing the ideas and logic. 

The first one-pager cost 14:30-17:30 (2.5 hours)
Iteration with AI for a presentable version:  I focus on the logic of each sentence. as long as the idea is clear, dont care about the writing style and specific wording. I just write the ideas, focusing of the overall structure (how many paragraphs, each par, what is the overarching sentence.). then within each paragraph, what are the main argument, what are the supporting evidence. how to use logical connectors to link sentences and transit smoothly. 

This step result in a raw draft of the result proposal. 

### Step 3. Revise with AI Assistance

Then i revise based on the raw input. I fit the raw writing second iteration: focus on transition flow of writing. 

- 1st iteration: logic within paragraph, i input the GPT5 with each par, ask for clarifing the key argument and logic flow of the paragraph. then i rewrite based on its suggestion.
- 2nd iteration: review the whole draft. after the first iteratation, i waited for a day. Then I read the whole draft again, correcting the writing WITHOUT AI. 
- 3rd iteration: I ask GPT5 to be critically and evaluate the draft as a grant reviewer, what are the weakness. i review its reviews and decide where to improve. and respond to its comments point by point. 
- 4th iteration: I ask GPT5 to proofread, only change grammar mistakes, typos, and suggest better wording. ONLY do mimimal changes to the text.

the 4 iteration takes about 2.5 hours. 

Output: i have a presentable draft of the research proposal for human feedback. i sent to my colleagues for feedback.
